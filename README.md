# Online WhatIf

Online WhatIf is a reimplementation of [What if? 2.0](http://www.whatifinc.biz/product.php), originally conceived and written by Dick Klosterman.  This is the WhatIf scenario module, which provides a RESTful backend to all functionality, and is intended to be used with [Online WhatIf UI](https://github.com/AURIN/online-whatif-ui), a web front end and [WorkbenchAuth](https://github.com/AURIN/workbenchauth), a simple authentication system.
