# Online WhatIf

Online WhatIf is a reimplementation of [What if? 2.0](http://www.whatifinc.biz/product.php), originally conceived and written by Dick Klosterman.  This is the WhatIf scenario module, which provides a RESTful backend to all functionality, and is intended to be used with [Online WhatIf UI](https://github.com/AURIN/online-whatif-ui), a web front end and [WorkbenchAuth](https://github.com/AURIN/workbenchauth), a simple authentication system.

For more information, see the [AURIN Project Page](http://aurin.org.au/projects/portal-and-infrastructure/what-if/).

You can try out [AURIN's Online WhatIf](https://whatif.aurin.org.au/whatif) instance, [contact AURIN](admin@aurin.org.au) for an account. If you'd like to set up your own Online WhatIf server, please see the [installation instructions](INSTALL.md).
